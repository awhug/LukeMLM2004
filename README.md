# LukeMLM2004
An attempt to reproduce scripts for "Multilevel Modeling" by Douglas A. Luke (2004) in lme4 for R.

This is a really nice little introductory textbook, although the dataset and scripts have unfortunately not been available for some time. Analyses recreate results of the book (models and visualisations), updated to use lme4 and the tidyverse (particularly ggplot) respectively, with data sourced from Dr. Luke's github.
